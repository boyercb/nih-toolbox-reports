		<p><strong>Patient Name: </strong>Test Subject1</p>
		<p><strong>Medical Record Number: </strong>CIP2276</p>
		<p><strong>Date of Test: </strong>07/05/2017</p>
		
		<p>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a system of highly reliable, valid, flexible, precise, and responsive assessment tools that measure patient-reported health status over the past 7 days.</p>

		<p>A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively worded concepts like anger, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison an anger T-score of 40 is one SD better than average. Percentile ranks are compared to normative data from the US population.</p>
